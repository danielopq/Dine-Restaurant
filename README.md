## Overview

I developed the frontend of a restaurant website based on a provided Figma design. The project was built using React with TypeScript and CSS, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.

The website consists of two main sections:

  - Home Page: This section provides key information about the restaurant, including its concept, location, and offerings. It also features a dynamic slideshow displaying high-quality images of the venue and its dishes, enhancing user engagement.

  - Reservations: Guests can easily book a table using a user-friendly reservation form. The form includes input validation to ensure accurate and complete data submission, improving the overall booking experience.

The website is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices for an optimal user experience across all screen sizes. Despite its simplicity, the design and functionality effectively serve the restaurantâ€™s needs, offering an intuitive and visually appealing interface.

## My process

I initially developed the website entirely for the desktop version, ensuring all elements were properly structured and aligned with the design specifications. After confirming that the desktop layout met all functional and aesthetic requirements, I proceeded to adapt the design for tablet and mobile devices.

The mobile and tablet versions were implemented using CSS media queries, allowing for seamless responsiveness across various screen sizes without the need for a complete redesign. By adjusting layouts, typography, and element positioning through media queries, I ensured a consistent user experience across devices while maintaining the integrity of the original design.

Key aspects of the process included:

  - Desktop-first approach for optimizing performance and usability on larger screens before scaling down to smaller devices.
  - Responsive layouts that dynamically adjust content and visuals, ensuring a clean and intuitive user interface on both tablets and smartphones.
  - Testing and optimization across multiple devices and browsers to ensure cross-platform compatibility and a smooth user experience on all devices.
