## Overview

The website for an architecture studio was developed using React and TypeScript, ensuring a robust and maintainable codebase. The homepage features an engaging slideshow showcasing a curated selection of the studio's projects, providing visitors with a dynamic introduction to its portfolio.

To enhance the user experience, the site integrates with Leaflet, an open-source JavaScript library, to display the studio's office locations on an interactive map. This functionality allows users to easily visualize and locate the offices.

A fully functional contact form is implemented with comprehensive data validation, ensuring that user inputs are correctly formatted before submission. This enhances both usability and data integrity.

The website is fully responsive, offering seamless performance and a visually consistent experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. Special attention was given to the design and layout to ensure accessibility and usability on screens of all sizes.

## My process

I initially developed the website entirely for the desktop version, ensuring all elements were properly structured and aligned with the design specifications. After confirming that the desktop layout met all functional and aesthetic requirements, I proceeded to adapt the design for tablet and mobile devices.

The mobile and tablet versions were implemented using CSS media queries, allowing for seamless responsiveness across various screen sizes without the need for a complete redesign. By adjusting layouts, typography, and element positioning through media queries, I ensured a consistent user experience across devices while maintaining the integrity of the original design.

Key aspects of the process included:

  - Desktop-first approach for optimizing performance and usability on larger screens before scaling down to smaller devices.
  - Responsive layouts that dynamically adjust content and visuals, ensuring a clean and intuitive user interface on both tablets and smartphones.
  - Testing and optimization across multiple devices and browsers to ensure cross-platform compatibility and a smooth user experience on all devices.
